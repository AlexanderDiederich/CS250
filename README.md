How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs is typically started when we analysis the system. The way that this can be done is through asking the team for their feedback, asking users about their expeirence and what changes they would like to see. User stories help with this because it helps with giving developers insight as to what it is our customers would like to see. User stories will help us with getting a better understanding of the end users perspective.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

There are a few different ways to approach developing programs. One of the different strategies is to use the waterfall method. Waterfall is a great development method when the project has a specifically set strategy that does not change. Another great method to use for project development is agile. Agile is different than waterfall because it is more flexible and allos for more testing, planning and for client integration to occur. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

In my personal opinion, being a good team member is understanding your role in the project development process. You should be making sure that your part is up to date with everyone else, and that you are not falling behind, because this could prevent others from getting their work done. Another trait that makes someone a good team member is when they listen to their co-workers and help others out when needed.
